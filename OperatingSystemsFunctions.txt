Operating systems track the functioning of computer hardware. They monitor and provide users with breakdowns of storage usage and availability. 

They also monitor CPU activity and load, energy use, battery life, as well as connected printers and ink levels.

Operating systems provide a way for users to meaningfully interact with system data. They allow users to input, manipulate and manage data. This happens when a user clicks on icons on a display.

Lastly, they manage programs running on a system. It often means that apps and other software can run on a computer simultaneously. The OS can keep them functioning properly.
